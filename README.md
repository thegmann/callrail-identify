callrail-identify
=================

Identify a CallRail caller by using their utma identifier and Webhooks.

Enter the company ID of the company account this is for from within your callrail app,
as well as your API key, and this will write the utma identifier with the callers phone number
to a text file called log.txt in the same directory.

Pull apart this snippet of code and use it for your own application.  I took the 20 minutes to put this together
and hopefully I can save you that 20 minutes, because programmers are lazy and I definitely spent longer than 20
minutes looking for someone else who had done it before I did.
